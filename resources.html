		Throughout making this website there were a few things that I wanted to do that were not covered in class.
		These things being the last three resources.  The stack overflow post helped me implement the htmldog PHP
		code that I had learned.  This was to get an email sent after creating the form.  I wasn't able to make this
		work with the RIT servers because I don't have enough permissions to send emails. w3schools helped teach me
		the syntax of creating forms in HTML.
	</p>
	<!-- Resources Explained -->
	<h1> Submission Explained </h1>
	<p>
		The graphic I created from scratch was the banner across every page.  I took this picture with my drone,
		added the text and added the color around the outside so it fades into the website.
	</p>
	<p>
		For embedded media, I have a video from my phone that loops on the homepage.
	</p>
	<p>
		The rollover effect is used on the leftmost image of the homepage. It takes you to the rooms page to 
		browse what is available.

	</p>
	<p>
		I have a PHP script that will be used on my personal webserver to send emails to people who would like 
		to book a room.
	</p>
	<p>
		The three factors that I personally think are done very well are the inviting homepage, the informative 
		about page, and the book now forms. The homepage is where I did all the main design. It needed to feel 
		inviting for anyone looking for a lodge near the beach. I wanted it to feel simple, informative, and 
		well done to prompt the viewer to take a look at our rooms available and book using the book now page. 
		The book now features I feel is super important this day and age because everyone wants to be able to 
		do EVERYTHING online. Although I wasn't able to fully flesh out a scheduling program. I was able to 
		design something that would easily get a customer in contact with us without them thinking too much or 
		really knowing about it. As for the About page, I feel that it is just informative and inviting enough
		to make someone want to visit and know that there will be plenty of things to do while they are there.
	</p>
	<p> 
		The book now the page is what I feel needs the most improvement. One is requiring the fields and checking
		that the text in each field is valid before submission. Ensuring there are no typos and no confusion. The 
		second improvement is the PHP scripting. Once I get it on my personal web server I will be able to fully 
		finish it and add more formatting and so on.
