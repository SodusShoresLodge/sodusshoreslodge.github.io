			<h1> Welcome to the Sodus Shores Lodge Website! </h1>
			
			<p>
				Starting in 2021 the Sodus Shores Lodge is officially under new ownership!  We are still currently getting
				on our feet but this is the new website.  Located right in the middle of Greig St., we are conveniently
				right in the middle of everything to do right on Sodus Point.  This means we're in walking distance of all of
				the great restaurants, stores that the point has to offer.  Just want to relax? We are also in walking distance 
				of the vast beach and historic Sodus Point Lighthouse.  Below is a video of your walk/drive to the beach.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				Currently, we have four different rooms to rent with a fifth coming very soon. To find out more about 
				our different rooms and amenities please check out the <a href="rooms.html">rooms</a> page of our 
				website. Keep in mind we are working on becoming more tech-friendly so our book now page will help you 
				get in contact with a Sodus Shores Employee to get an official booking set in stone.
			</p>
